    <h1> US Air Quality Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Overall Introduction</h3>

    <p> Air quality is a pivotal environmental issue that directly 
        impacts public health and well-being. Every year, millions 
        of people worldwide are affected by poor air quality, which 
        is linked to a range of severe health problems. According to 
        the World Health Organization (WHO), the combined effects of 
        ambient air pollution and household air pollution are associated 
        with 6.7 million premature deaths annually. This highlights the 
        critical need for rigorous air quality management. Criteria pollutants, 
        including ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO), 
        sulfur dioxide (SO2), and particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10), are 
        particularly concerning due to their prevalence and health impacts. 
        Exposure to high levels of these pollutants can lead to acute 
        respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases, worsened asthma, 
        and other health issues. Specifically, WHO estimates that in 2019, 
        some 37% of outdoor air pollution-related premature deaths were due 
        to ischemic heart disease and stroke, while 18% and 23% of deaths were 
        due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and acute lower 
        respiratory infections respectively, and 11% were due to cancer 
        within the respiratory tract.</p>

    <p> This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these pollutants 
        in the United States from 2000 to 2023, offering insights into their 
        concentrations, distribution, and trends over time. By understanding 
        the dynamics of air quality, this study seeks to inform public policy, 
        contribute to environmental health research, and pave the way for effective 
        interventions that could dramatically reduce the health burdens associated 
        with air pollution.</p>

    <h3>Introduction to the data</h3>

    <p> Our analysis utilizes information from the United States Environmental 
        Protection Agency and the Center for Disease Control.</p>  
    <p>EPA:</p>
    <p>We concatenated annual summary files that contain information about criteria 
        pollutants by county from the years 2000 up until 2023.  This resulted in a 
        file with 25,000 rows and 18  columns. The relevant columns are listed below.</p>

        <h3>Median AQI Over Time</h3>
        <p>To begin, we created a high-level visualization that maps the changes in the 
            median Air Quality Index (AQI) over time across the United States. The AQI 
            serves as a gauge of air quality, where lower values indicate cleaner air. Our 
            analysis reveals that the highest median AQI occurred in 2007, while the lowest 
            values were observed in 2009 and 2020. The significant improvement in air quality 
            from 2007 to 2009 can be attributed to the 2008 financial crisis, during which 
            widespread job losses led to reduced commuting and, consequently, fewer emissions. 
            Similarly, the sharp decrease in AQI in 2020 coincided with the global COVID-19 
            pandemic, which saw travel restrictions and reduced economic activity contributing
             to markedly cleaner air. These findings emphasize the direct impact of human 
             mobility and economic activity on air quality.

                <p>This interactive visualization utilizes plotly to show the median air quality 
                    index(AQI) by state over time from 2000 to 2023. The darker the shade of red
                     indicates a higher AQI. By pressing the play button, the user can watch as the 
                     median AQI changes over time by state. Using the slider, the user can go directly
                      to a specific year to observe as well. The user can hover over each state to see 
                      the year, state name, and median air quality index.
                </p>
                <p>From this visualization, some interesting insights are: first, the upper northwest 
                    portion of the country tends to have better air quality compared to other regions.
                     The south east tends to have the poorest air quality. Another important trend to 
                     note is that as time has passed, the western part of the country’s air quality has 
                     gotten a bit worse. This is a reflection of increased forest fires in the western
                      part of the United States and as result, there are elevated levels of particulate 
                      matter of 2.5 diameter, ozone, and nitrogen dioxide.

        <h3> Feature Importance</h3>

        <div class = 'image'>
            <img src="top10feature.png" width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0"></img>

        <div class = 'container'>
            
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> To gain a deeper understanding of the factors predicting the number of 
                    days with varying levels of air quality—from good to hazardous—we employed
                     a random forest regression model supplemented by cross-validation. During
                      preprocessing, we explored the impact of geographical variations by one-hot 
                      encoding states. However, the encoded state variables did not significantly 
                      influence the model's predictions, as reflected by their negligible feature 
                      importances. The target variables were the count of days classified as good, 
                      moderate, unhealthy for sensitive groups, unhealthy, and hazardous based on 
                      air quality. The cross-validation results revealed a mean R-squared value of
                       0.779 and a mean MSE of approximately 50.265, indicating a robust model with 
                       substantial predictive capabilities. 'Median AQI', 'Days PM2.5', and 'Days Ozone' 
                       emerged as the most influential predictors, reinforcing the critical role of specific 
                       pollutants in determining air quality. The 'Year' variable held minimal importance, 
                       suggesting that environmental conditions on a day-to-day basis are more significant 
                       than the specific year's data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These results led us to reevaluate the feature selection, opting to categorize 
                    the United States into broader regions rather than by individual states. This 
                    approach reduced the model's complexity without sacrificing its predictive power. 
                    The feature importance graph further highlighted that median air quality indices
                     and the number of days with elevated levels of PM2.5 and ozone are more indicative
                      of air quality than the regions, emphasizing that air quality interventions should 
                      prioritize the management of these pollutants. As elevated levels of PM 2.5 and ozone 
                      can occur from forest fires, air pollution and global warming, this further 
                      corroborates the previous interactive visualization depicting how median AQI 
                      has changed over time. By shedding light on these factors, our model directs 
                      attention to actionable environmental policies and initiatives that could be 
                      most effective in improving air quality.

        <p>For our visualization using Altair, we decided to plot a bar graph that shows the 
            prevalence of diseases by state. We chose to visualize diseases that have a strong 
            positive correlation with air pollution, such as cancer, chronic asthma, chronic 
            heart disease, and stroke. The interactive features in this visualization include: 
            tooltip that shows the data value of each disease within a certain county, and a 
            dropdown where you can select a state. The marks and channels are bars and length.

        <h3>Max AQI across US</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization we try to explore the Max AQI between
            states. Using width or x-axis and color we are able to see which states 
            have the highest AQI. It shows that California has the highest Max AQI which
            is consistent with the heat map as well.  
        </p>

        <h3>Summary and additional work</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we were able to explore the different air quality particulates 
            and their impact on health across the US. We noticed some patterns. There was lower AQI during 
            periods of less travel that occured due to financial or pandemic reasons. The northwest portion 
            of the US has a lower AQI compared to the rest of the country. Ozone and fine particulate matter
            influence AQI the most. California Counties have the worst AQI and the highest prevalence of disease.
        </p>

        <p> In the future, we would like to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>integrate wind and temperature data</li>
            <li>develop specific regulatory measured based on analysis findings</li>
            <li>trying other ML models to yeaild better prediction results</li>
            <li>implement targeted interventions in areas with poor air quality</li>
